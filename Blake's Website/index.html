            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><span></span>I began programming in Java during my sophomore year of high school, and since then,
                I’ve developed several projects that I’m proud of. One of my early accomplishments
                was designing a 2D platformer and boss rush game using Unity and C#. Players had to
                navigate challenging obstacle courses and face unique boss fights at the end of each level.<br><br>
                <span></span>In college, I developed a mobile chess app for Android using Java and Android Studio in collaboration
                with a partner. The app allowed users to move pieces only when a move was valid, review previous games,
                save replays, and even receive AI-generated move suggestions.<br><br>
                <span></span>Throughout my journey, I’ve continued to explore and build projects that deepen my passion
                for software engineering. I’m a fast learner and an effective communicator.
                With a background in acting, I’m confident in presenting ideas clearly and engagingly, both individually
                and in team settings.
